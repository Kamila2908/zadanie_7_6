        It’s so loud Inside my head
        With words that I should have said!
        As I drown in my regrets
        I can’t take back the words I never said
        I can’t take back the words I never said</pre>

        I really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
        Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
        How much money does it take to really make a full clip
        9/11 building 7 did they really pull it
        Uhh, And a bunch of other cover ups
        Your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
        If you think that hurts then, wait here comes the uppercut
        The school was garbage in the first place, thats on the up and up
        Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the uppercrust
        You get it then they move you so you never keeping up enough
        If you turn on TV all you see’s a bunch of “what the f-cks”
        Dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
        And that aint Jersey Shore, homie thats the news
        And these the same people that supposed to be telling us the truth
        Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
        Gaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn’t say shit
        Thats why I aint vote for him, next one either
        I’ma part of the problem, my problem is I’m peaceful
        And I believe in the people.</pre>

        Now you can say it aint our fault if we never heard it
        But if we know better than we probably deserve it
        Jihad is not a holy war, wheres that in the worship?
        Murdering is not Islam!
        And you are not observant
        And you are not a muslim
        Israel don’t take my side cause look how far you’ve pushed them
        Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the Kush went
        Complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for?
        Complain about the gloom but when’d you pick a broom up?
        Just listening to Pac aint gone make it stop
        A rebel in your thoughts, aint gon make it halt
        If you don’t become an actor you’ll never be a factor
        Pills with million side effects
        Take em when the pains felt
        Wash them down with Diet soda!
        Killin off your brain cells
        Crooked banks around the World
        Would gladly give a loan today
        So if you ever miss payment
        They can take your home away!</pre>
